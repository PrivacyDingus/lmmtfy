## Basic Introduction

The idea came from "Let me help you Baidu", this thing came out for a long time, at the same time, "Let me help you Google" also have, but there are all kinds of inconvenience, either is the age of the old style, or is the territory access is a little difficult. So took the time to change one out.

Thanks to [Sukka](https://github.com/SukkaW) for providing the network environment judgment program.

Based on these two programs: [https://github.com/bangbang93/lmbtfy.cn](https://github.com/bangbang93/lmbtfy.cn) and [https://github.com/mengkunsoft/lmbtfy ](https://github.com/mengkunsoft/lmbtfy)

Demo site: [https://moedog.org/tools/google/](https://moedog.org/tools/google/)

## Notes for consumption

First of all, the environment needs PHP, which is used to generate short links; secondly, it is important to mention one of the advantages of this program, which can determine whether the user's network can access Mojeek or not, and if it can't, then call the reverse generation site to access it.

But this anti-generation site needs to program builders to prepare their own, this program comes with only by my station call.

Edit lmgtfy.js, replace www.loli.cab with your own Google antisite link, or www.google.com if you don't have it.
